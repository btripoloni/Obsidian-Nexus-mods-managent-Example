# Mod Description
  ![http://i.imgur.com/QPCwXtN.png](http://i.imgur.com/QPCwXtN.png)

<br />An armor compilation mod assembled by Hothtrooper44.
<br />With great contributions from Eckss.

<br />If you're seeking to enhance your Skyrim with a greater selection of armor sets without breaking from the natural feel of the game, this mod is for you. It adds many new armor sets that have been seamlessly integrated into the world. The items are balanced and spread across your gaming experience. You will be finding new, power appropriate armor sets starting from level one up to level fifty and beyond.
<br />
<br />This mod will be constantly evolving to bring new life into your world. Currently this mod adds 55 new sets of armor to the game (over 60 including variants), tons of additional non-set helmet options, 396 new shields, and a large number of other items such as eye patches, capes, earrings, scarves and more! There are 2693 files in all. They are all craftable, upgradable, enchantable and are integrated into the game through leveled lists, quest rewards, placement in dungeons and/or onto specific people.
<br />
<br />Immersive Armors is highly customizable through the in game MCM menu or spell menu. Since at the time there is no MCM menu for SSE, I encourage you to try out the spell menu, found in the shout powers section of the magic menu.
<br />
<br />Here are some of your customization options:
<br />
<br />[*]Toggle on/off distribution for an item
<br />[*]Toggle on/off crafting for an item
<br />[*]Toggle on/off distribution to a specific race
<br />[*]Toggle on/off distribution to a specific culture
<br />[*]Toggle on/off distribution to specific enemy types (Bandits, Draugr, Forsworn, Hunters, Thalmor, etc.)
<br />[*]Toggle on/off varied guards helmets
<br />[*]Toggle on/off the ability to break down items in smelters for parts
<br />[*]Toggle on/off overall NPC armor use of IA items
<br />[*]Toggle on/off whether IA items will appear in vendor lists for sale
<br />[*]Toggle unarmored/light/heavy armor type for various armor sets
<br />[*]Toggle various mesh variants for some items
<br />[*]Toggle various texture variants for some items
<br />[*]Toggle mod compatibility for some mods (many popular mods are detected and made compatible with no changes from you)

The Nexus community is the reason I continue to create mods. Thank you.

<br />
<br />Q: The Immersive Armors Configuration has Finished message appears repeatedly.
<br />A: Your game and/or save are corrupt. Assuming you have SkSE, you can try:
<br />Load a save from before you installed IA.
<br />Go to an interior cell (like a player home)
<br />In the Console enter: ClearInvalidRegistrations 1
<br />Then save your game.
<br />Try installing IA on that save.
<br />
<br />Q: I am upgrading from version X to version Y. Anything I need to know?
<br />A: No. I make installation a one click process for your ease of use.
<br />
<br />Q: Will you make a CBBE patch?
<br />A: Link in the 3rd sticky post.
<br />
<br />Q: I have the following NMM error:
<br />Failure
<br />A problem occurred during install
<br />..."system.outofmemoryexception"...
<br />The mod was not installed
<br />A: This error has nothing to do with my mod. This is an error thrown by NMM 32bit for all large files.
<br />For 32bit NMM users, I suggest a manual install. My mod is only 3 files. It is easy to keep track of.
<br />Go tell the Nexus staff to fix this. The best way to be heard is to speak. 
<br />
<br />Q: The download for this file on Nexus Mod Manager keeps stopping before it's finished! Help!
<br />A: This is a problem with the NMM program, and unrelated to this mod. Navigate to C: -&gt; Games -&gt; Skyrim -&gt; mods -&gt; downloads. Delete anything with the name hothtrooper44_ArmorCompilation found there. Also do the same for the cache folder found under mods. Now download again.

<br />v8.1  log:
<br />- Converted meshes to new SSE standards
<br />- Updated shader flags to new SSE standards
<br />- Fixed an issue with the female Dwarven Mage gloves that could cause a crash

<br />- Added body slide to a few models where it was not functioning
<br />
<br />v8 log:
<br />- Delayed most of Immersive Armor's startup processing until after the player's handcuffs are removed. By slightly delaying the run time of Immersive Armor's distribution script, this should aid in removing the bouncing cart from the start of the game when a user with a weaker CPU is running many scripted mods at launch.
<br />- Increased Alternate Start mod compatibility when selecting the default Helgen start.
<br />- Extensively modified the item distribution script for efficiency and efficacy.
<br />- Introduced many extra Configuration Menu options - check them out!
<br />- Updated integrated compatibility for a variety of popular mods.
<br />- Included basic English language versions of MCM translation files for all official languages(no more "$" signs for languages other than English in the MCM menu).
<br />- Tons of new options to control distribution to npc/monster groups such as Creatures, Afflicted, Alikr, Bandits, Battlemages, Draugr, Forsworn, Hunters, Khajiit, Orcs, Robbers, Sailors, Soldiers, Thalmor, Vampires, Vigilants, Warlocks
<br />- Added safety checks to prevent smelting of equipped items.
<br />- Multiple minor fixes such as the first person model for Ebony Mage Armor being altered, etc.
<br />
<br />v7.1 log:
<br />- Tribunal Masks have been changed to use the mask slot.
<br />- Gold Earrings have been changed to use the ear slot.
<br />- The Eyepatch has been changed to use the misc slot.
<br />- Bandannas have been changed to stop them from hiding the misc slot when worn.
<br />- A menu option has been added for compatibility with "Alternate Start" mods.
<br />- A menu option has been added to remove the quest and gameplay based requirements for crafting armors.
<br />- Made Boiled Chitin Armor Configurable - Light/Heavy
<br />- Split Dragonscale Ebonsteel Armor off from Dragonbone Ebonsteel as Light Armor variant
<br />- Altered Dragon Knight Armor to provide a Light Armor variant
<br />- Made Gildegreen Aegis Configurable - Light/Heavy
<br />- Made Glacial Crystal Armor Configurable - Light/Heavy
<br />- Removed Cloak slots from all but standalone cloaks for greater compatibility
<br />- Fixed Painted Shield tempering
<br />- Fixed Exporting errors &amp; flags in certain meshes
<br />- Fixed invisible Jorrvaskr Shields on vampires
<br />- Added Translation Strings to MCM Menu
<br />- Fixed other minor issues
<br />- Added Ritual Armor of Boethiah book to the tent near the Shrine
<br />

<br />- Full gender support was updated for every item in this pack.

<br />- Removed the hanging fur hood varients from the lvled lists (still craftable) and from guards for less clipping with Cloaks of Skyrim and other such mods.
<br />- The crafting materials were reworked for every item in this pack to be more intuitive.
<br />- Prices of many items were reworked for balance.
<br />- Some sets were moved from higher levels to lower ones to better flesh out the early game experience:
<br />- Viking Heavy Armor has been changed from Ebony stats/perks/lvl lists to Steel stats/perks/lvl lists
<br />- Viking Light Armor has been changed from Glass stats/perks/lvl lists to Leather stats/perks/lvl lists
<br />- Mercenary Armor has been changed from Daedric stats/perks/lvl lists to Leather stats/perks/lvl lists

<br />- Reworked the scaling on many female helmets to make them better fit.
<br />- Fixed issues with the Vanguard gloves and boots and body slide scaling.
<br />- Renamed the Vagabond Armor variants to be more lore friendly.
<br />- Adjusted the Vagabond Leather Armor sleeves to fix a misalignment issue.
<br />- Added more helmet variation to some guard factions.
<br />- Removed the Redguard Knight Armor with the cape, and instead made the cape standalone and you can choose to equip it with the Redguard Knight Armor or any other armor.
<br />- Fixed a normal map issue with the Falkreath Shield.
<br />- Moved the Heroic Imperial Armor off of low level Imperial Captains for early game balance. This set will now have a 50% chance to spawn on Imperial Captains over the level of 20. It also appears on Hadvar for sport.
<br />

<br />- "Witchplate Armor" by Telthalion has now been included in this mod.
<br />- Added dialogue options for the armors to NPCs! Now some NPCs will see your armors/weapons/shields from this mod and say relevant lines. For example:
<br />Wearing the Dwarven Mage Armor: "That's some fine armor, Dwarven make, am I right?"
<br />Wearing Heroic Stormcloak Armor, an Imperial might say: "How dare you wear that Stormcloak filth here!"
<br />Wearing Mercencary Armor: "That's the armor of a mercenary right there."
<br />There are 1-4 lines for every piece in the mod!
<br />- Placed Ulag's Sack in the Sleeping Tree Cave as intended.

<br />- Removed the enchantments and extra armor of the Vanguard helmets.

<br />- Fixed crafting component bug for the Hunter Armor set.
<br />
<br />v4 log:
<br />- "Apotheus Light Armor" by GuitunScarfin has now been included in this mod by the author's suggestion. This is truly a well made set and the lore back-story is top notch.
<br />- "Nordic Hunter Light Armor" by frankdema has now been included in this mod by the author's suggestion. One of the best sets for a hunter themed character without a doubt!
<br />- "Heroic Stormcloak Armor" by lumps has now been included in this mod by the author's suggestion. This is a great compliment to the mod as it adds an upgrade to the Stormcloak side similar to the "Heroic Imperial Armor" already in the pack.
<br />- "Seadog Armor" by me (hothtrooper44) is now included in the mod.
<br />- Some earnings created by humannature66 from "HN66s Earrings" were added.

<br />- Fixed an incorrect path with the Dwarven Mage Argonian Helmet.
<br />- Fixed a crafting issue with the Redguard Coif.

<br />
<br />v3.1 log:

<br />- Fixed some crafting recipes for the Einherjar set.
<br />- Fixed an issue that made the fur hoods uncraftable.
<br />
<br />v3 log:
<br />- "Einherjar Armor" by Omesean has now been included in this mod by the author's suggestion. There couldn't be a better armor set to fit into this pack, thanks Omesean.
<br />- "Fur Hoods HD" by Northborn has now been included in this mod by the author's suggestion. This hood pack is fantastic and 100% lore fitting for the tundra of Skyrim. Amazing work Northborn, and thanks.
<br />- A new "relic" shield has been added to the pack. It's called "Aegis of Life" and can only be found on difficult NPCs at level 50+ with a very low drop rate. Alternatively, it can be crafted with the Daedric smithing perk.
<br />- Integrated new items into leveled lists.
<br />- Added Akaviri Samurai Armor set into the Skyhaven Temple.
<br />- Snipped two CK bug world edits. (thanks jacktthompson and crazyjackal)
